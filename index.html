        <p> Hi my name is Surya and I study in grade 7. My favourite hobby is playing football. Now I know that playing football will keep my fit and healthy. Playing football is a good way to enjoy, feel happy. During my free time I go down and play football, but nowdays because of the lockdown I have to play it in the house and can't play with my friends, but I still manage to play football at home.

        <p> During the lockdown I felt really bored so I started playing video games to entertain myself. After a while I felt like I can create a youtube channel and post my gameplay. After editing my first Montage I posted it and it got a lot of views. I was really happy. Nowadays I find it really fun editing my videos and playing.
